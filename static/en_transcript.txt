hello friends welcome to a new happy
learning video
have you ever wondered how plants feed
to answer this question we need to
understand
[Music]
photosynthesis
photosynthesis is a process in which
plants make their own food to be able to
grow and develop
in order to perform photosynthesis they
need various elements
sunlight
carbon dioxide obtained from air and
water
and chlorophyll which is a green
substance that all plants have
and is fundamental for performing
photosynthesis since it could not happen
without it
[Music]
by the way chlorophyll is what gives all
plants the green color but
how does photosynthesis take place
look at this plant
as you can see its roots are anchored to
the ground
and through them the plant absorbs water
and minerals in the soil
water with minerals are transported up
the stem reaching the leaves
the leaves are full of tiny pools called
stomata which absorb carbon dioxide that
the air in the surrounding contains
all this containing water minerals and
carbon dioxide is called
raw sap
now it's chlorophyll's turn
the chlorophyll in the leaves has all
the necessary ingredients for
photosynthesis to take place
and when it receives sunlight the
process begins by transforming the raw
sap
into elaborated sap which also
circulates around the plant and works as
food
[Music]
all plants feed from elaborated sap and
they store it in their roots like a
carrot
or in their fruit like an apple or a
pear
now we know how photosynthesis takes
place but
why is it so important
without plants there would be no life on
earth we wouldn't have oxygen to breathe
or food to feed on
you already know that herbivores eat
plants and carnivores eat herbivores
plants are fundamental for the food
chain
and they are also fundamental for our
respiration
actually when humans breathe we turn
oxygen into carbon dioxide
quite the opposite of when plants
perform photosynthesis
a curious fact you need to know is that
at night
because plants don't have sunlight to
photosynthesize they breathe like humans
do they take in oxygen and release
carbon dioxide
remember that
and one last thing so you understand the
importance of photosynthesis
when plants absorb dirty and
contaminated gases they transform them
into pure air into oxygen and this way
they clean the atmosphere and all nature
plants are the best solution to fight
against contamination don't you think
